# Image-Upload-Demo
a temporary solution to firebase storage image uploading problem.

while developing a project using firebase, i encounterd a problem. that is i cannot upload any images to 
firebase storage.So i searhed on internet about the problem and found out
it happens only in Bangladesh. So, i searched a little more and found out this simpler but working solution.

I encoded the image to a string and pushed that string to firebase database and to set that image into somewhere,
just decoded it to bitmap. this is not a good solution but for small projects, it works.
